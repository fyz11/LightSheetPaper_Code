This repository contains a collection of scripts that is broadly categorised by analytical theme for the paper:

[**Single-cell phenomics reveals behavioural and mechanical heterogeneities underpinning collective migration during mouse anterior patterning**](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.31.534937v1.abstract), *bioRxiv*, 2023, written by Stower et al.

The scripts were not initially developed as a reusable library in mind. We make it available here organized by analysis theme to serve as a guide reference for the computational analyses described in the main and methods section of the paper so that readers may take snippets from.

## Tested Python and OS Environment
These scripts were developed initialy with Python 2.7 and MATLAB 2019b. It was verified to work also with Python 3.6/3.7 with corresponding compatible MATLAB versions on Windows 7/10 and linux (Ubuntu 17) OS systems.
