This repository contains a collection of scripts that is broadly categorised by analytical theme for the paper:

[**Single-cell phenomics reveals behavioural and mechanical heterogeneities underpinning collective migration during mouse anterior patterning**](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.31.534937v1.abstract), *bioRxiv*, 2023, written by Stower et al.

It currently primarily serves as a guide reference for the computational analyses presented in the paper which readers may take snippets from.
